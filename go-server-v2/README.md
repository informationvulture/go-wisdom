## go-server-v2
This server project is designed to be a private web app that you can use to store URLs. Instead of downloading them to your local machine, you can store them in the cloud.

The current way this app is setup is by allowing the user to access a form and enter a URL, tag, and password. If the password is incorrect, the app won't download the URL (for security purposes).


## TODOs
- Find a better way to organize the code (possible long term project)
- Improve the UI (* MINOR *)
- Add more security features that Go offers
